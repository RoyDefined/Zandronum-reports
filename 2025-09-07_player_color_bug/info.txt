Zandronum 3.2.1
For some reason players are not able to change their player color when wearing a skin.

Status: Not a bug. This is caused because morphing forgets your player's translation.
By adding a proper color range and storing the translation elsewhere when morphing, you can then give this info back and the translations will work.
